= Geolocation App

This geolocation app demonstrates the use of PostGIS.

PostGIS is a spatial database extender for PostgreSQL object-relational database. It adds support for geographic objects allowing location queries to be run in SQL.

The app accepts file uploads, stores the records in a database, and then displays a list of locations ordered by distance from a given point (lat/lon).
